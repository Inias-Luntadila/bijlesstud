Alright, setting up a MySQL database with these specifications is like a stealth mission in League of Legends, you have to be precise and make sure every step is executed perfectly. Let's break it down into bite-sized pieces:

### Step 1: Install MySQL

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mysql-server
```

### Step 2: Secure MySQL (Optional but recommended)

Execute the security script:

```bash
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

### Step 3: Configure MySQL User and Permissions

1. **Log in to MySQL:**

   ```bash
   sudo mysql
   ```

2. **Create the database 'check':**

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE check;
   ```

3. **Create the user 'check':**

   ```sql
   CREATE USER 'check'@'yoda.uclllabs.be' IDENTIFIED BY 'rDEetGxq82DCE';
   ```

4. **Grant permissions:**

   ```sql
   GRANT INSERT, SELECT ON check.log TO 'check'@'yoda.uclllabs.be';
   ```

5. **Apply the changes:**

   ```sql
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```

6. **Exit MySQL:**

   ```sql
   EXIT;
   ```

### Step 4: Create the 'log' Table

1. **Log in to the 'check' database:**

   ```bash
   mysql -u check -p -h yoda.uclllabs.be check
   ```

2. **Create the 'log' table:**

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE log (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
       text VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
   );
   ```

### Step 5: Configure the Web Page

1. **Set up a PHP script on `http://slimme-rik.sasm.uclllabs.be/mysql_check.php`** to fetch and display the most recent row from the 'log' table. The script will connect to the MySQL database, execute a query to fetch the latest 'text' from the 'log' table, and display it.

   The PHP code snippet might look something like this:

   ```php
   <?php
   $conn = new mysqli("localhost", "check", "rDEetGxq82DCE", "check");

   if ($conn->connect_error) {
       die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
   }

   $sql = "SELECT text FROM log ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 1";
   $result = $conn->query($sql);

   if ($result->num_rows > 0) {
       while($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
           echo "Most recent string: " . $row["text"];
       }
   } else {
       echo "0 results";
   }
   $conn->close();
   ?>
   ```

### Step 6: Limit the Rows in the 'log' Table

Ensure that the 'log' table maintains a row count between 80 and 100. You might need to create a scheduled event or a trigger to check and delete the oldest entries when the row count exceeds 100.

Remember, these are just the bare bones! Adjust the firewall and security settings to ensure that the user 'check' can only connect from 'yoda.uclllabs.be'. Also, always test each step to make sure everything works as intended.
