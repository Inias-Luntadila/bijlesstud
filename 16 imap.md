# IMAP

Install and configure an IMAP server and make sure it meets the following specifications:

    1. Your SMTP server is functioning correctly and receives mail for 'user1@'

    2. SSL/TLS is enabled and the server listens on port 993 (default port).

    3. User 'user1@ferre-verheyen.sasm.uclllabs.be' can log in and read email.

## Assignments

    To install and configure an IMAP server that meets your specifications, you can use Dovecot, a popular IMAP and POP3 server. Here's a short guide on how to do it:

1. **Install Dovecot:**

   ```
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install dovecot-imapd dovecot-pop3d
   ```

2. **Configure Dovecot:**

   - Edit the Dovecot configuration file:
     ```
     sudo nano /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf
     ```
   - Ensure the protocols line includes `imap`:
     ```
     protocols = imap pop3 lmtp
     ```

3. **Enable SSL/TLS:**

   - Edit the SSL/TLS settings in the Dovecot configuration file:
     ```
     sudo nano /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-ssl.conf
     ```
   - Make sure SSL is enabled and specify the certificate and key:
     ```
     ssl = yes
     ssl_cert = </path/to/fullchain.pem
     ssl_key = </path/to/privkey.pem
     ```

4. **Set the listening port to 993 (default for IMAP over SSL/TLS):**

   - By default, Dovecot listens on port 993 for IMAP over SSL/TLS, but you can confirm this in:
     ```
     sudo nano /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-master.conf
     ```
   - Look for the service `imap-login` block and ensure it has:
     ```
     port = 993
     ssl = yes
     ```

5. **Configure Mail Location:**

   - Edit mail location settings in Dovecot:
     ```
     sudo nano /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-mail.conf
     ```
   - Define the mail location:
     ```
     mail_location = maildir:/var/vmail/%d/%n
     ```

6. **User Authentication:**

   - For user 'user1@ferre-verheyen.sasm.uclllabs.be', ensure you have the user set up on your system or within Dovecot's user database. see SMTP

7. **Restart and Enable Dovecot:**

   ```
   sudo systemctl restart dovecot
   sudo systemctl enable dovecot
   ```

8. **Test the Configuration:**

   - Use an email client or a command-line tool to test IMAP connectivity and login with 'user1@ferre-verheyen.sasm.uclllabs.be'.

9. **Ensure your SMTP server (like Postfix) is correctly configured:**

   - This includes making sure it's configured to receive mail for 'user1@' and is properly integrated with Dovecot if necessary.

10. **Firewall and Security:**
    - Ensure your firewall allows traffic on port 993.
    - Regularly update your SSL/TLS certificates and keep your server software up to date.

## Handy stuff

Logging in to the IMAP server via the command line and enabling plaintext logging for troubleshooting purposes can be done, but it's important to handle these tasks with caution due to the sensitive nature of the information involved.

1. **Logging in via Command Line:**
   You can use `telnet` or `openssl` to connect to your IMAP server. If you're using SSL/TLS (which you should be), you'd want to use `openssl`. Here's how:

   ```sh
   openssl s_client -connect ferre-verheyen.sasm.uclllabs.be:993
   ```

   After the connection is established, you can use IMAP commands to log in. For example:

   ```
   a login user1@ferre-verheyen.sasm.uclllabs.be password
   ```

   Replace `password` (for user1: aabbceeeeeeefhlllmnrrrrssssuuvy) with the actual password. The `a` at the beginning is a tag that prefixes your commands â€“ it can be anything.

2. **Enabling Plaintext Logging:**

   - **Dovecot:**

     - Edit the Dovecot configuration to enable verbose logging. Open the `10-logging.conf` file:
       ```sh
       sudo nano /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-logging.conf
       ```
     - Add or update the following lines to enable plaintext logging:
       ```sh
       auth_verbose = yes
       auth_verbose_passwords = plain
       auth_debug = yes
       auth_debug_passwords = yes
       mail_debug = yes
       ```
     - This configuration will log verbosely, including plaintext passwords during the authentication process. Be very cautious with this setting, as it can expose sensitive information in your logs.

   - **Restart Dovecot** to apply the changes:
     ```sh
     sudo systemctl restart dovecot
     ```

3. **Viewing the Logs:**
   - The log files are typically located in `/var/log/`. For Dovecot, you might find the logs in `/var/log/dovecot.log` or similar, depending on your syslog configuration.
   - To view the logs, you can use:
     ```sh
     sudo tail -f /var/log/dovecot.log
     ```
   - Or use `grep` to filter for specific entries:
     ```sh
     sudo grep 'login' /var/log/dovecot.log
     ```

**Important Security Notes:**

- Enabling plaintext logging of usernames and passwords is risky and should only be done in a secure, controlled environment, and only for the duration necessary to troubleshoot specific issues.
- Ensure that you disable verbose logging and especially password logging (`auth_verbose_passwords`, `auth_debug_passwords`) as soon as you are done troubleshooting to prevent any sensitive information from being stored or exposed in logs.
- Regularly monitor and manage the access to your server and log files, ensuring that only authorized personnel have access.

**read mails after logging in**

After logging in to your IMAP server via the command line, you can use IMAP commands to interact with your mailboxes and emails. Here's a basic guide on how to open and read mails using IMAP commands:

1. **Select a Mailbox:**
   After logging in, you'll usually start in the INBOX folder by default. You can select a mailbox (also known as a "folder") using the `SELECT` command. For example, to select the INBOX:

   ```
   a SELECT INBOX
   ```

   The server should respond with details about the INBOX, including the number of messages.

2. **List Messages:**
   To list messages, you can use the `FETCH` command. For example, to get an overview of the first 5 messages:

   ```
   a FETCH 1:5 (FLAGS BODY[HEADER.FIELDS (SUBJECT FROM)])
   ```

   This command fetches the FLAGS, and the SUBJECT and FROM header fields of the first 5 messages.

3. **Read a Specific Message:**
   To read the entire content of a specific message (for example, message number 2), you can use:

   ```
   a FETCH 2 BODY[]
   ```

   This command fetches the entire body of the 2nd message. Be aware that this will display the raw email, which includes the headers, body, and possibly HTML or other encoded content depending on the email.

4. **Searching for Emails:**
   You can search for emails that match certain criteria. For example, to find all emails from "example@example.com":

   ```
   a SEARCH FROM "example@example.com"
   ```

   The server should respond with a list of message numbers that match the search criteria.

5. **Deleting an Email:**
   To delete an email, you first mark it with the `\Deleted` flag and then expunge the mailbox. For example, to mark the 2nd message for deletion:

   ```
   a STORE 2 +FLAGS (\Deleted)
   ```

   And then to permanently remove all messages marked for deletion:

   ```
   a EXPUNGE
   ```

6. **Logout:**
   When you're done, don't forget to log out properly:

   ```
   a LOGOUT
   ```

**Note:** The `a` before each command is a tag used to identify each command and its responses. It can be any string and doesn't have to be `a`, but it should be unique for each command you send in a session.

IMAP commands can be quite low-level and working directly with them can be complex, especially when dealing with MIME-encoded messages or attachments. For regular use, a mail user agent (MUA) that provides a more user-friendly interface for these tasks is recommended.

If you need to work with emails programmatically, consider using a library or framework appropriate for your programming language that provides higher-level abstractions for IMAP interactions.

**login with telnet**
If SSL/TLS is not enabled and you want to use telnet to connect to your IMAP server, you'll be connecting to the default IMAP port which is 143. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Open your terminal or command prompt.**

2. **Use the telnet command to connect to your IMAP server:**

   ```sh
   telnet ferre-verheyen.sasm.uclllabs.be 143
   ```

3. **Wait for the server's greeting message.** This message indicates that the server is ready for commands.

4. **Log in with the LOGIN command:**
   ```sh
   a LOGIN user1@ferre-verheyen.sasm.uclllabs.be yourpassword
   ```
   Replace `yourpassword` with the actual password of `user1@ferre-verheyen.sasm.uclllabs.be`. The `a` at the beginning is a command tag; it can be any string and is used to correlate commands with responses.

After logging in, you can use the IMAP commands I mentioned in the previous message to interact with your mailbox.

**Security Note:**

- It's highly discouraged to send credentials over a non-encrypted connection like telnet due to the risk of credential interception. Always use secure methods to access your email, such as IMAP over SSL/TLS.
- If you're setting up your mail server, it's recommended to configure and enforce the use of SSL/TLS as soon as possible to protect your data and credentials.

**master user login and reading messages**
Configuring a master user (sometimes referred to as an admin or service account) in Dovecot allows you to access user mailboxes without knowing the users' passwords. This is particularly useful for administrative tasks, backup, or migration. Here's how you can set it up and log in:

### 1. **Configure Dovecot for Master User Authentication:**

1. **Create a passdb configuration for the master user:**

   - Edit or create a new passdb file. For instance, `10-master.conf` in the `conf.d` directory of Dovecot's configuration.
     ```sh
     sudo nano /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-master.conf
     ```
   - Add the following configuration:
     ```ini
     passdb {
       driver = passwd-file
       args = /etc/dovecot/master-users
       master = yes
       pass = yes
     }
     ```
   - This tells Dovecot to use the `master-users` file for authenticating master users.

2. **Create the master-users password file:**

   - Use `doveadm` to create a password for the master user. Replace `masteruser` with the username for your master user and set a strong password.
     ```sh
     sudo doveadm pw -s SHA256-CRYPT
     ```
   - Copy the generated hash.

   - Create or edit the `master-users` file:
     ```sh
     sudo nano /etc/dovecot/master-users
     ```
   - Add the master user credentials in the format `masteruser:{password-hash}`. For example:
     ```ini
     masteruser:{SHA256-CRYPT}$5$rounds=5000$...
     ```
   - Save and close the file.

### 2. **Configure Usernamespaces to Allow Master User Access:**

- Edit the `10-auth.conf` file to allow master user impersonation:
  ```sh
  sudo nano /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-auth.conf
  ```
- Add or ensure the following lines exist:
  ```ini
  auth_master_user_separator = *
  ```
- This configuration specifies the character used to separate the master user from the original username. In this case, `*` is used.

### 3. **Restart Dovecot:**

- After making changes to the configuration, restart Dovecot to apply:
  ```sh
  sudo systemctl restart dovecot
  ```

### 4. **Log in as Master User:**

- To log in as the master user and access a user's mailbox, you use the master user's name and the target user's name, separated by the separator character (`*` in this case). Use an IMAP client or telnet/openssl for this. For instance, with `openssl`:
  ```sh
  openssl s_client -connect ferre-verheyen.sasm.uclllabs.be:993
  ```
- Then use the LOGIN command with the master user credentials and the user you want to access:
  ```sh
  a login masteruser*user1@ferre-verheyen.sasm.uclllabs.be masterpassword
  ```
- Replace `masteruser` with your master user's name, `masterpassword` with your master user's password, and `user1@ferre-verheyen.sasm.uclllabs.be` with the user whose mailbox you want to access.

### **Important Security Notes:**

- Master users have significant privileges. Protect master user credentials carefully.
- Use strong, unique passwords for master users.
- Regularly review and audit master user access and activities.
- Ensure communication is encrypted (SSL/TLS) when transmitting sensitive data like passwords.

Accessing and reading mailboxes from other users as a master user in Dovecot involves similar steps to accessing a mailbox with regular user credentials, with the addition of specifying the master user credentials. Once you've logged in as a master user, you can use standard IMAP commands to interact with the user's mailbox. Here's how you can do it:

### 1. **Log in as Master User:**

- Use the `openssl` or `telnet` command to connect to your Dovecot server (depending on whether you're using SSL/TLS).
  ```sh
  openssl s_client -connect ferre-verheyen.sasm.uclllabs.be:993
  ```
- Log in with the master user's credentials, followed by the target user's username, separated by the master user separator (e.g., `*`).
  ```sh
  a login masteruser*user1@ferre-verheyen.sasm.uclllabs.be masterpassword
  ```
  Replace `masteruser` with the master user's username, `masterpassword` with the master user's password, and `user1@ferre-verheyen.sasm.uclllabs.be` with the username of the user whose mailbox you want to access.

### 2. **Select the Mailbox:**

- After successfully logging in, select the mailbox (e.g., INBOX) you want to access.
  ```sh
  a SELECT INBOX
  ```

### 3. **List and Read Messages:**

- **List Messages:**
  - To list messages in the mailbox, use the `FETCH` command. For example, to list the subjects of the first 5 messages:
    ```sh
    a FETCH 1:5 (FLAGS BODY[HEADER.FIELDS (SUBJECT)])
    ```
- **Read a Specific Message:**
  - To read a specific message (e.g., message number 2), you can use the `FETCH` command to get its body:
    ```sh
    a FETCH 2 BODY[]
    ```
  - This command will return the entire body of the 2nd message, including headers and content.

### 4. **Perform Other Actions:**

- As a master user, you can perform various actions just like a regular user, such as searching for emails, marking them as read, deleting, etc., using the appropriate IMAP commands.

### 5. **Logout:**

- When you're finished, remember to properly log out from the session:
  ```sh
  a LOGOUT
  ```

### **Security and Privacy Considerations:**

- Be aware of the privacy and legal implications of accessing users' email. Ensure you have proper authorization and a legitimate reason for accessing user mailboxes.
- Ensure that the use of master user access is logged and auditable.
- Limit the use of master user access to only those times when it is absolutely necessary.

Using a master user in Dovecot provides powerful capabilities for administration and support, but it must be managed carefully to ensure security and privacy.
